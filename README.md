# AI-Driven-OSINT
AI-Driven OSINT for Automated Intelligence Gathering using ML models (Naive Bayes, SVM, LSTM).

This project automates Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) collection and analysis using AI & ML.
It focuses on detecting cyber threats, misinformation, and online aggression from social media
and news platforms.

# Tech Stack
Python 3.11 | Scikit-Learn | TensorFlow | NLTK | Tweepy | Pandas | NumPy

# Models Implemented
- Naive Bayes: Cyberbullying & hate-speech detection  
- SVM: Fake-news detection  
- LSTM: Time-series social-threat analysis  

# Datasets
- `cyberbullying_tweets.csv`
- `fake_and_real_news.csv`

# How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

# Results
Naive Bayes Accuracy ≈ 85 %
SVM Accuracy ≈ 90 %
Evaluation: Precision, Recall, F1-Score
